# Software-Defined-Radio-Using-Raspberry-Pi-master

Refers to a technique in which all the signal processing is done in software.

The processing mentioned include mixing, filtering, demodulation etc.

The software can be used to implement different demodulation schemes and different
 standards can be implemented in the same device.

The software can be updated so the device doesnâ€™t become obsolete with time.

## SDR vs Traditional Radio

Traditional radio chips are hard-wired to communicate using one specific protocol. 
In contrast, software-defined radio hardware works with raw electromagnetic signals, 
relying on software to implement specific applications.

The most obvious benefit is that instead of having to build extra circuitry to handle 
different types of radio signals, you can just load an appropriate program.

Traditional Radio has not changed in over a 100 years. Software-defined radio will 
make it possible to use the electromagnetic spectrum in fundamentally new ways.
